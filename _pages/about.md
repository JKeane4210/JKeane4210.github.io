Hello. I am Jonathan Keane, but everyone calls me Jonny.

For a while now, I have been interested in understanding how AI models learn to solve problems. While I think there is a lot that can be learned by just looking at the math of these models, I feel that where this math leads/what a model converges to can have an extra story regarding how models think about things. Because of this curiosity, I have been very interested in AI interpretability, as well as NLP regarding language understanding and reinforcement learning geared towards reasoning capabilities.

When I am not working on something related to AI, I like to live a pretty active life. I play soccer, run, rock climb, and play volleyball. I also am a big reader *(if I can find the time to fit it in)*. A mix of some sci-fi, novels, and philosophy usually, but I am pretty open to suggestions. I have a couple more creative hobbies in drawing and playing music. I played the clarinet for several years when I was in high school/middle school, but I have recently started learning piano over the past 2 years.
