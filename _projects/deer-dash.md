During the summer of 2020, my friend Kacper Mocarski wanted to work on a new project and learn something new while the world was in lockdown in the beginning months of the pandemic. This process began with several zoom calls trying to come up with ideas. Eventually, we decided on making a 3D game in the game engine Unity where the player would be driving down a highway where there are a lot of deer (or other animals) crossing the road. You would have to manage your fuel and your car's health while picking up power-ups to see how long you could last.

We also learned how to design 3D models for cars and animals in the 3D modeling software Blender. I made several animals, landscapes, and cars in the final game. This experience was valuable because it showed the amount of work it takes to make a video game. After all, in between sprites, graphics, music, sound effects, and functionality, there is so much that goes into making a great game.
